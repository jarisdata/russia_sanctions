# EU trade sanctions against Russia
The linked Google Colab Jupyter Notebook provides an interactive visualization of the EU trade sanctions against Russia. The product trees offer a particularly fine-grained picture of the sanctioned trade thanks to the use of 8-digit CN Codes. The Eurostat data behind the graphs is taken directly from the Eurostat API. If you are interested in the code snipped for updating the data with the Eurostat API, shoot me a message.
